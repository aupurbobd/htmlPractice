						<blockquote>
							The freedom to express varying and often opposing ideas is essential to variety 
							of conceptions of democracy. If democracy is viewed as essentially a process – 
							a way in which collective decisions for a society are made – free expression is 
							crucial to the openness of the process and to such characteristics as elections, representation of interests, and the like.
